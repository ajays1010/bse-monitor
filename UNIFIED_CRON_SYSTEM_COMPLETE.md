# BSE Monitor - Unified Cron System - COMPLETE ✅

## 🎯 **Solution Summary**

Your BSE monitoring application now has a **unified cron system** that handles all three monitoring types with a **single UptimeRobot trigger**. The system intelligently schedules jobs based on time and market conditions.

## ✅ **What's Implemented**

### 🔧 **Unified Master Endpoint**
- **URL**: `/cron/master?key=your_secret_key`
- **Frequency**: Every 5 minutes via single UptimeRobot
- **Intelligence**: Automatically determines which jobs to run based on:
  - Current IST time
  - Market hours (9:00 AM - 3:30 PM)
  - Working days (Monday-Friday)
  - Job execution history

### 📊 **Three Monitoring Types**

#### 1. 🔴 **BSE Announcements** 
- **Schedule**: Every 5 minutes, 24/7 (continuous)
- **Function**: `send_bse_announcements_consolidated()`
- **Purpose**: Monitor new BSE announcements and send AI summaries + PDFs
- **Always runs**: Yes (critical for real-time announcements)

#### 2. 📈 **Live Price Monitoring**
- **Schedule**: Every 5 minutes during market hours (9:00 AM - 3:30 PM) on working days
- **Function**: `send_hourly_spike_alerts()`
- **Purpose**: Monitor significant price/volume changes and send alerts
- **Conditions**: 
  - Working day (Monday-Friday)
  - Market hours (9:00-15:30 IST)

#### 3. 📊 **Daily Summary**
- **Schedule**: Once daily at 4:30 PM (16:30) on working days
- **Function**: `send_script_messages_to_telegram()`
- **Purpose**: Send comprehensive stock summary with prices and moving averages
- **Conditions**:
  - Working day only
  - Time window: 16:25-16:35 (10-minute window)
  - Duplicate prevention (once per day)

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **Master Controller Logic**
```python
@app.route('/cron/master')
def cron_master():
    # 1. Authenticate with secret key
    # 2. Get current IST time and market status
    # 3. Determine which jobs to run based on time/conditions
    # 4. Execute jobs for all users with monitored stocks
    # 5. Log results and return comprehensive status
```

### **Intelligent Scheduling**
```python
# Job 1: BSE Announcements (always run)
jobs_to_run.append({
    'name': 'bse_announcements',
    'condition': True,  # 24/7 monitoring
    'reason': 'Continuous monitoring'
})

# Job 2: Live Price Monitoring (market hours only)
if is_working_day and is_market_hours:
    jobs_to_run.append({
        'name': 'live_price_monitoring',
        'reason': f'Market hours: {market_open} - {market_close}'
    })

# Job 3: Daily Summary (16:30 ±10 minutes, once per day)
if should_run_summary and not already_run_today:
    jobs_to_run.append({
        'name': 'daily_summary',
        'reason': f'Scheduled time reached: {current_time}'
    })
```

## 🔧 **UptimeRobot Configuration**

### **Single Monitor Setup**
1. **Monitor Type**: HTTP(s)
2. **URL**: `https://multiuser-bse-monitor.onrender.com/cron/master?key=c78b684067c74784364e352c391ecad3`
3. **Monitoring Interval**: 5 minutes
4. **Monitor Timeout**: 60 seconds
5. **HTTP Method**: GET

### **Replace Multiple Monitors**
❌ **OLD (Multiple monitors):**
- `/cron/hourly_spike_alerts` - Every 5 min during market hours
- `/cron/bse_announcements` - Every 5 min, 24/7  
- `/cron/evening_summary` - Once daily at 16:30

✅ **NEW (Single monitor):**
- `/cron/master` - Every 5 min, intelligent scheduling

## 📱 **Expected Behavior**

### **During Market Hours (9:00-15:30, Mon-Fri)**
```
🕘 09:05 - Runs: BSE announcements + Live price monitoring
🕘 09:10 - Runs: BSE announcements + Live price monitoring  
🕘 09:15 - Runs: BSE announcements + Live price monitoring
...
🕘 15:25 - Runs: BSE announcements + Live price monitoring
🕘 15:30 - Runs: BSE announcements + Live price monitoring
```

### **After Market Hours (15:30-09:00)**
```
🕘 15:35 - Runs: BSE announcements only
🕘 15:40 - Runs: BSE announcements only
...
🕘 16:25 - Runs: BSE announcements only
🕘 16:30 - Runs: BSE announcements + Daily summary (once)
🕘 16:35 - Runs: BSE announcements only
```

### **Weekends**
```
🕘 All times - Runs: BSE announcements only (continuous monitoring)
```

## 📊 **Response Format**

The `/cron/master` endpoint returns detailed JSON with execution status:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T16:30:15.123456+05:30",
  "run_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "market_hours": false,
  "working_day": true,
  "executed_jobs": [
    {
      "name": "bse_announcements",
      "reason": "Continuous monitoring",
      "users_processed": 2,
      "notifications_sent": 5,
      "users_skipped": 0,
      "errors": []
    },
    {
      "name": "daily_summary",
      "reason": "Scheduled time reached: 16:30",
      "users_processed": 2,
      "notifications_sent": 2,
      "users_skipped": 0,
      "errors": []
    }
  ],
  "skipped_jobs": [
    {
      "name": "live_price_monitoring",
      "reason": "Outside market hours or non-working day. Market: false, Working day: true"
    }
  ],
  "errors": []
}
```

## 🔐 **Security Features**

1. **Secret Key Authentication**: `CRON_SECRET_KEY` prevents unauthorized access
2. **Service Role**: Uses Supabase service role for database operations
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and logging
4. **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against abuse

## 📈 **Monitoring & Logging**

### **Verbose Logging**
Set `BSE_VERBOSE=1` in `.env` to see detailed execution logs:
```
BSE: user=700aef12... new_items=0 recipients=1
AI: Analysis successful for document.pdf, generating message...
✅ Message sent successfully to Telegram 453652457
```

### **Database Logging**
All cron executions are logged in `cron_run_logs` table:
- `run_id`: Unique execution identifier
- `job`: Job type (bse_announcements, live_price_monitoring, daily_summary)
- `user_id`: User being processed
- `processed`: Success/failure status
- `notifications_sent`: Number of messages sent
- `recipients`: Number of recipients

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **Manual Testing**
```bash
# Test unified endpoint locally
curl "http://localhost:5000/cron/master?key=c78b684067c74784364e352c391ecad3"

# Test production endpoint
curl "https://multiuser-bse-monitor.onrender.com/cron/master?key=c78b684067c74784364e352c391ecad3"
```

### **Test Script**
Use `test_unified_cron.py` to verify functionality:
```bash
python test_unified_cron.py
```

## 🔄 **Migration Steps**

### **1. Update UptimeRobot**
- Delete existing monitors:
  - `/cron/hourly_spike_alerts`
  - `/cron/bse_announcements` 
  - `/cron/evening_summary`
- Create single monitor:
  - URL: `https://multiuser-bse-monitor.onrender.com/cron/master?key=c78b684067c74784364e352c391ecad3`
  - Interval: 5 minutes

### **2. Monitor Transition**
- Keep old endpoints for 24 hours (gradual transition)
- Monitor logs for successful job execution
- Verify all three job types run correctly

### **3. Cleanup (Optional)**
- Remove old individual cron endpoints after successful migration
- Clean up old cron configuration files

## ⚡ **Performance Benefits**

1. **Single HTTP Request**: One UptimeRobot call instead of three
2. **Intelligent Scheduling**: Jobs only run when needed
3. **Shared Context**: User/scrip data loaded once per execution
4. **Better Logging**: Centralized execution tracking
5. **Reduced Server Load**: Optimized database queries
